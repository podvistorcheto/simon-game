m Mini-project for Simon memory game

1. Refactoring the code for colors for eventhandling
2. Add fifth color
3. Instead of rounds the sequence to be played it should be a highscore for the player to win the game (or actually add an endless mode for playing the game)
4. Look out for name conflict for variable names
